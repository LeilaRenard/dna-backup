Added storage worker
====================

This worker is charged to make IO calls when storing chunk data. This way writes
are asynchronous and `matchChunks` can continue without being interrupted.

This is not a huge improvement, but at the same time, hashes are stored which
makes them a lot faster to recover (no need for rehashing every existing chunk).
